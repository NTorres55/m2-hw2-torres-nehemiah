### Issues

1. I had difficulty center aligning the container.
2. I had difficulty with the grid layout - figuring out if row was necessary; it didn't keep items in row when I wanted (responsively) so I didn't use it and it.
3. I added a .gitignore file thinking I needed it for the screenshots but then realized that you wanted to see them so I was just tripped up and confused for a while with what to do with it or just ignore it.
4. I had problems with the break points in responsiveness and what to do with the super large images in mobile view. Also when I added rows it kept it at fixed height/width which made the images look all distorted - another reason i didn't use it.

### Outside Sources Used

1. [I used getbootsrap.com as a reference](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/layout/overview/) for Layout, grid, centering title and alert.
2. I also used the forum on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to troubleshot some issues I had and work them out.
